My C language repository, from the time I was learning C around 2012/2013
These are exercises from the book "Programming in C, 4th ed." by Stephen G. Kochan.
The C in front of a file name stands for Chapter, the E for exercise.
The files with P in front of the name are just examples in the book that I decided to code and run myself, so P10.9.c means it's the example shown in Chaper 10, Program 9.
